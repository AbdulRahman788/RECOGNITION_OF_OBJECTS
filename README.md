## Introduction
Object recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves identifying and classifying objects within images. This project aims to provide an implementation of an object recognition pipeline using deep learning techniques. The code allows users to load a dataset, preprocess the data, define and train a deep learning model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions on new images.

## Installation
To run the code locally, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these libraries using the pip package manager:
```
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the "RECOGNITION_OF_OBJECTS_" notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
3. Make sure you have the required dataset available or replace the dataset loading code with your own dataset loading code.
4. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the code step by step.
5. Customize the code as needed for your specific object recognition task.

## Dataset
The specific dataset used for object recognition is not mentioned in the code provided. Make sure to replace the dataset loading code with your own dataset loading code or use a compatible dataset.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture used in this code is built using the Keras API. It includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers. The model is designed to learn and extract meaningful features from the input images and make predictions based on those features.

## Training
The model is trained on the loaded dataset using the fit() function provided by Keras. The training process involves specifying parameters such as batch size, number of epochs, and validation data. The model's weights are updated during training to minimize the defined loss function and improve accuracy.

## Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated on a separate test set to measure its performance in object recognition. The evaluation metrics, including accuracy and loss, are calculated and displayed to assess the model's effectiveness.

## Predictions
The code demonstrates the model's ability to make predictions on a few test images. It displays the predicted classes, true labels, and corresponding images, allowing for visual comparison and analysis.
